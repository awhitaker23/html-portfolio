<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello world! My name is Breezy, short for Aubri and I love just about anything to do with electronics. 
   I live not far from the city capitol in the southern-state of Arkansas. Its a natural state, and not only do I happen to
   live in a tourtist town, it also doubles as a National Park so there's always plenty to do.</p>
  
<p>However most of the time I can be found inside with my two cats and dog, tinkering with a new gadget or 
   binging action movies on Netflix. When I'm not checking out some new drama with stellar fight scenes,
   I'm usually curled up on my sofa with the latest manga or new and upcoming grapic novel. </p>

<p>Did i mention also that I love to learn? Currently when I'm not doing any of that fun stuff.. 
   I have my phone in hand learning spanish via Duolingo or I'm in front of my laptop following along 
   to Angela's "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"!</p>
